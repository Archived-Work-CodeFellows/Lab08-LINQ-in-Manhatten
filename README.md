# Lab08-LINQ-in-Manhatten

This is a demonstration and practice for taking in a JSON file, deserializing it and utilizing LINQ and Lambda expressions to affect the data in specific ways. This is built in the C# language and Visual Studio IDE.

The LINQ expressions used in this project display all data, removes empty strings, removes duplicates and one LINQ expression that combines all three. There is a Lambda expression that also has the same functionality of the larger LINQ statement.
